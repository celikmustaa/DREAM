DREAM projects are for undergraduate students currently studying at the Department of Computer Engineering in Hacettepe University.

Counting Small Subgraphs in Networks
Project Description: Counting small subgraphs, called motifs, in complex networks has been a well-studied problem in network analysis of various real-word graphs. 
In this project, we will investigate state-of-the-art counting methods and study on developing heuristic counting techniques.
